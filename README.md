# 🏡 California Housing Price Prediction

Welcome to the **California Housing Price Prediction** project! 🚀 This is a hands-on machine learning project where we explore and predict housing prices in California using various regression models. Our primary focus here is on the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we dive deep into:

- 🧹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis.
- 🛠 **Feature Engineering**: Selecting, transforming, and scaling features for better model performance.
- 🏋️ **Model Training**: Building and training regression models like KNN, Random Forest, and more.
- 🎯 **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, R², and visualizations.
- 🔧 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

## 💡 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Scikit-learn
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn
